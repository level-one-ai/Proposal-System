        <h2 class="page-header">Understanding Your Challenges</h2>
        <p class="page-subheader">Before we can solve a problem, we need to understand it. This section outlines the key challenges we've identified through our discussions, and why addressing them is crucial for your business growth.</p>
        
        <div class="letter-content">
            <p>Dear <span class="editable" id="clientName">Rafal</span>,</p>
            
            <p style="margin-top: 15px;">
                Thank you for taking the time to discuss your business needs with us. After our conversations, 
                it's clear that you're facing several operational challenges that are limiting your growth potential 
                and consuming valuable resources that could be better spent elsewhere.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The good news? Every challenge you're facing has a solution. Modern automation and AI technologies 
                can transform these pain points into competitive advantages. Below, we've summarized the key issues 
                we'll be addressing together.
            </p>
        </div>

        <ul class="bullet-list">
            <li><span class="editable" id="problem1">Creating product descriptions, categorizing items, and managing inventory consumes hours of staff time daily—time that could be spent on growth activities.</span></li>
            <li><span class="editable" id="problem2">Customers frequently contact support for basic inquiries like order status and returns, overwhelming your team with repetitive tasks.</span></li>
            <li><span class="editable" id="problem3">Without data-driven insights, you're making inventory and marketing decisions based on intuition rather than actionable intelligence.</span></li>
            <li><span class="editable" id="problem4">Every visitor sees the same products and content, missing opportunities for personalization that drives conversions and loyalty.</span></li>
        </ul>

        <div class="letter-content" style="margin-top: 25px;">
            <p>
                The following pages detail exactly how we'll tackle each of these challenges, the timeline 
                for implementation, and the investment required. If you have any questions at any point,

        <h2 class="page-header">The Problems We'll Solve</h2>
        <p class="page-subheader">Each challenge below represents not just a problem, but an opportunity. By automating these processes, you'll free up resources, reduce errors, and create a foundation for scalable growth.</p>

        <ul class="problem-list">
            <li>
                <strong class="editable" id="detailProblem1Title">Manual Content Creation Bottleneck</strong>
                <span class="editable" id="detailProblem1Desc">Writing unique, SEO-optimized product descriptions for hundreds or thousands of items is time-consuming and inconsistent. AI-powered content generation will create compelling descriptions in seconds, not hours.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong class="editable" id="detailProblem2Title">Fraud Vulnerability</strong>
                <span class="editable" id="detailProblem2Desc">Without real-time fraud detection, you're exposed to chargebacks and fraudulent orders. AI monitoring can analyze transaction patterns instantly and block high-risk orders before they're processed.</span>

            <li>
                <strong class="editable" id="detailProblem3Title">Support Team Overload</strong>
                <span class="editable" id="detailProblem3Desc">Your team spends valuable time answering repetitive questions that could be handled automatically. An AI chatbot can resolve 80% of common inquiries 24/7, freeing your team for complex issues.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong class="editable" id="detailProblem4Title">Missed Personalization Opportunities</strong>
                <span class="editable" id="detailProblem4Desc">Static product displays and one-size-fits-all recommendations leave conversion potential on the table. Predictive AI can deliver personalized experiences that dramatically increase engagement.</span>
